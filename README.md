# Mammogram Birads & Density Classification
_Reader should install this repo in a virtual environment_
## Installation Instruction
Assuming you are using a single GPU 0, for multi-level projector `resnet50`, run the command ``python train.py -m mt_prj_resnet50``. For single-level projector resnet101, run the command ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py -m sg_prj_resnet101``. For baseline resnet101, run the command ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py -m resnet101``. Similarly for other ResNet variants. Check the file **train.py** for more information.  
Please install **Python 3.8+**.  
[Link to download the dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1svFSy2Da3cVMvekBwe13mzyx38XZ9xWo). You just need the **images** folder only.  
Replace ``name = k[:]`` by ``name = k[7:]`` in **utils/auto_load_resume** if you resumes training a model which is trained on multiple GPUs.  
***Note***: in the model names, sg: single_level, mt: multi-level.
